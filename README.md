# Final-Project-1-survey-form-

I am so so happy to have completed my first personal project on freeCodeCamp's responsive web design course!

I have a long way to go and a long journey to take but it's good to compare yourself to where you were before. Just two weeks ago I had no clue where to even start and now I am here with an entire responsive survey website coded on my own!!
